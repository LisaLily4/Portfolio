  <h1>About Me</h1>
  
<body style="background-color:lightblue;">
  
<p style="font-size:200%;">Hi there!I'm Lisa but call me Lily.Welcome to my website where you can learn many things about me.I love music mostly all types, because of the way you can close off the world and everyone around you.Reading is another way that I block out all my problems and worries and it's a good thing that books are unlimited. I love playing sports and also writing stories of my own. My dream career is to become a cardiologist and everything I do is to help accomplish that goal.</p>

<p style="font-size:200%;">Some of my favorite foods are obviously pizza,ice-cream,cookies,mac&cheese.I play more video games than I go out with friends.I think it's because I believe I'm socially awkward but my friends tell me it's because I have a very unique way of looking at things. I have few friends because I honestly don't feel all that interested in people.I rather fiction characters in books and in movies and I wouldn't know if that's weird because people don't really know.
